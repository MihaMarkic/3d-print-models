# 3d print models

A collection of 3d print models. I create them for my needs and print them currently on [Prusa i3 MK2](https://www.prusa3d.com/).

## Raspicluster

Additional components compatible with [Raspberry Pi Stackable Tray](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2187350).

One provides attachment to MikroTiK RouterBOARD RB750Gr3 which I use as a, well, router. View it on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2757838).

The other part contains a mount for ANKER PowerPort 5 USB charger.
